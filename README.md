1. Go to this page: `chrome-extension://kmffehbidlalibfeklaefnckpidbodff/manifest.json`

2. Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C).

3. While on the extension page (A), click the chrome://kill bookmark (B). The page should crash. MAKE SURE TO READ STEP 4 BEFORE DOING STEP 3.

4. INSTANTLY start spamming chrome://hang (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or ctrl+R). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 
    
If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then it worked. You can close your tabs and the extension will be blown up successfully. If nothing loads, then you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slow. This isn't rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal.


Note that the steps above are by no means the only way to perform the exploit. I'll add the first alternate set of instructions on May 11th for people affected by patches.
